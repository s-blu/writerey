# Roadmap

writerey is still in active development and has way to go until it hits v1.0. Here, we want to give you a overview what you can expect in future.

This is of course subject to change. It is furthermore not possible to give a time frame since writerey is a hobby project that needs to share the little, available free time with other cool stuff.

You can have a up-to-date, more detailled and more technical look on the roadmap [here](https://github.com/s-blu/writerey/projects/7).

## version 0.9

Version 0.9 focuses on reducing technical debt as well as bug fixing, so there are no big features planned here.

## version 0.10

0.10 will introduce the **Template Feature**. With that, you'll be able to define template documents and projects that you can select when creating a new document or project. This will come handy for repeating things like character sheets.

Alongside that, we plan to further improve usability and UI.

## version 0.11

0.11 will introduce several improvements on the **note system**. The note system is one of the core features of writerey and we want it to be better useable, more intuitive, and more feature rich.

## version 0.12

0.12 will introduce the **history** to view and access your snapshots in-app.

## version 1.0

Until version 1.0 we plan to add the following features:

- A automated remote backup of your files on a configurable place
- Interactive user guide explaining the application
- Export documents to different formats like Word
