## Writer-what?

Writerey is a tool that wants to help you with your next writing project:  A novel, an essay for school, a research, a poem booklet, ... you name it!

It provides you a distraction free place to sort your thoughts and write down your ideas. It keeps your project safe with autosave functionality and snapshots. It provides you handy functionality to note down thoughts and side-infos.

## Attention Attention: Still in beta!

Please be aware that writerey is still in active development and did not hit v1.0 yet. Some things are broken, some are incomplete, some are simply not available yet. 

With that said, writerey is in a useable state and we try our best to ensure backward compatibility so that you won't lose any data. If you are interested into having a early look, please be welcome to try it out. We would value your constructive feedback a lot!

If you prefer to wait for a comfortable and stable version, please visit us again when we hit v1.0 :)

Thank you!
