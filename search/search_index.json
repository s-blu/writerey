It is a text file that will be saved as .html to your local disk space, relative to the installation path of writerey. You'll use documents to write your story, your background informations, plan plots and so on. Create a document \u00b6 You can create documents only inside of a project. Navigate into a project, if you have not already Click the \"More\" Menu on the top right corner of the side bar Choose \"Create Document\" Choose a Name and hit \"Create\" Create a document in an existing folder \u00b6 Hover over the folder in the sidebar Click on the \"More\" Menu that appears on the tree entry Choose \"Create Document\" Choose a Name and hit \"Create\" Rename a document \u00b6 In the explorer, hover over the document you want to rename Click on the More Menu on the explorer entry Select \"Rename\" A dialog appears. Type in the new name for your document. Click \"Rename\" Technical note : On every rename, writerey creates a snapshot to reflect this change. Don't wonder: If you rename a folder only in a casesensitive way (i.e. \"characters\" to \"Characters\") writerey will create two snapshots to prevent problems that can occur on these cases. Move a document \u00b6 In the explorer, hover over the document you want to move Click on the More Menu on the explorer entry Select \"Move\" You've now entered the move mode. Hover over folders in your explorer to let the \"Move here\" arrow appear. Click on the arrow on the folder you want to move your document If you want to move it to the root, click on the Arrow at the very bottom of the tree, right from the \"(To Root)\" label To cancel a move, click on the X beside the document you are just moving. Technical note : On every move, writerey creates a snapshot to reflect this change. Delete a document \u00b6 In the explorer, hover over the document you want to delete Click on the More Menu on the explorer entry Select \"Delete\" Confirm the dialog that pops up Technical note : On every delete, writerey creates a snapshot before deleting the document to give you a chance to get it back, if necessary. Use the Editor \u00b6 Writerey uses CKEditor 5. Most of the handling works just like in any other writing application. If you have doubts or question to editor specifica, the official CKEditor website is probably a good place to look. After creating or navigating into a document, you'll get access to the sheet of paper in the middle. Above you'll have a toolbar that allows to modify how part of your document looks and also give you the possibility to i.e. insert tables and files. Hover over the icons to get a description of what they do. Switch document modes \u00b6 Right below the editor, you have three modes available. When you click on one of these, your document switches mode. Switching document modes affects the visibility of ui elements as well as the state of the editor. Read \u00b6 The Read mode gets all the clunky, distracting stuff out of the way and puts your document into a readonly state. This way, you can check (or simply enjoy) your work without distraction. Tip : To achieve the same for the other document modes, use the distraction free toggle . Write \u00b6 This is the mode to actively edit your document. You will probably stay in Write Mode most of the time. It lets you edit your document and shows you all the context informations you need in a read mode and hides creation of notes and modification of label values. Review \u00b6 In the review mode, you'll see all ui elements you need to add or modify context informations like label values and note items. You are still able to edit your document here, too. Activate a paragraph \u00b6 Activating a paragraph gives you the possibility to maintain label values and paragraph specific notes on it. Open up a document Either be in write or review mode Place the editor cursor in the paragraph you want to activate by clicking in it or moving the cursor via keyboard there After a short moment, a thin blue border will appear on the left side. This paragraph is now active. You'll now see its label and note informations and be able to edit both for this specific paragraph in the review mode. Attention : To be able to activate a paragraph you'll need to switch to Review Mode at least once after his creation. Technical Background: While doing this switch to Review Mode, writerey is calculating and adding some meta informations to your document that the app needs to be able to save paragraph specific informations. Save a document \u00b6 Writerey saves automatically for you, every time you do a tiny writing pause. You see that your document got saved when the Save Icon in the lower right corner wiggles and the saved date updates. It also saves when you leave the document. There is no manual action that you need to do. Access documents outside of writerey \u00b6 Do you wonder where your precious ideas go? Don't worry: Right on your disk space, always accessable for you, even without the app. All documents are saved as .html files under <installation path of writerey>/_writerey_data/<project-name>/ to make sure you can always access your work, no matter the circumstances. If you want you can open these documents via a Web Browser and edit them in any text editing tool. Please be aware that you'll then edit the source code of the html document and not the rendered version, like you would in writerey, so things could look a bit ugly. Please pay attention to not break the html structure of an file. writerey will not be able to open up such documents. Add label values to paragraphs \u00b6 You'll need a existing label with label values in order to assign them. Please be aware that labels are only valid in project scope, that means every project has its own labels. Open up your document Switch to review mode Activate a paragraph On the left side, you'll now have your created labels displayed. Choose the values you want to assign to this paragraph. When you now switch back to Write mode and your cursor is inside this paragraph, your labels will show up and - if available - you'll see your label info on the right side. Add label values to documents \u00b6 Currently, you can only add label values to specific paragraphs.

Use on other Windows versions could work but are untested. If you want to use it for another OS, please refer to the development guide to build a fitting executable. To use writerey, you need following third party software installed: Python 3 Git What is Python? Why do I need it? \u00b6 Python is a popular programming language, just like Java. Do you remember installing and updating the Java environment (JRE) all the time, back in the old day? I still see the \"[very large number] devices run java\" screen before my inner eye. Python is already part of Linux and iOS, so you can use it there without installing it separately. On Windows machines, you need to teach Windows to understand it first. You need it to use writerey because writerey's backend is written in Python. Windows won't be able to run the app without understanding Python. Do you want to learn more? Visit the official website or its wikipedia page . How do I install Python? \u00b6 Get it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ Run the installer Check \u201cadd Python 3.8 to Path\u201d Click on Customize installation Uncheck all but pip and py launcher Choose installation path like you wish and hit Install Click Close to finish python installation What is Git? Why do I need it? \u00b6 Git is a VCS, a Version Control System. A VCS is one of the fundamentals of software development and Git is a fairly popular choice for a VCS (if not the choice). In short, it takes care that developers can jump back to a old version of their code base and that they can have a look what changed between two versions. Developing without a VCS is quite hard to imagine. In writerey, we use Git to do the exact same for your writing project: To make sure you can always jump back to an old version of your files or to check what you've changed. The snapshot functionality is powered by git. It archives your first draft, your second, your 23rd one for you so that you don't need to do that manually. Do you want to learn more? Visit the official website or its wikipedia page . How do I install Git? \u00b6 Installing Git can be a bit alienating, since there are a lot of options to choose from. Fear not though, most of the time you can just hit Next. Get it here https://git-scm.com/downloads Run the installer. Accept the GNU License Choose a installation path you want Uncheck \u201cWindows Explorer Integration\u201d, you won\u2019t need it.

A VCS is one of the fundamentals of software development and Git is a fairly popular choice for a VCS (if not the choice). In short, it takes care that developers can jump back to a old version of their code base and that they can have a look what changed between two versions. Developing without a VCS is quite hard to imagine. In writerey, we use Git to do the exact same for your writing project: To make sure you can always jump back to an old version of your files or to check what you've changed.

Does this paragraph belong to chapter 1, 2 or 14? Is this paragraph a first draft, the second one or already final? Which scene it belongs to? Which story line? Who's the Point of View character? Where does it take place? The label itself is only like a folder for files. To really use them, you need to add values to them. A value consists of two properties: A name and a info (or description). The name is the real value and what you will choose when assigning labels . The info on the other hand will show up as a special kind of note, so this is the right place to add all the important bits that concern this label value.

Save labels \u00b6 When on a label detail view, you can save your changes by clicking the blue \"Save\" Button at the bottom of the page. Alternatively, you can enable automatic saving. Automatic saving on labels works just like it does on documents: If you change anything, no matter in which tab or field, and do a tiny pause, it will save the label.

What is a label info template? \u00b6 When creating a label and its label values, you'll sometimes find yourself in the situation that you want to maintain similar structured information in your label values descriptions. For example, maybe you want to note down for each scene you have where it takes place, how long it lasts, who will appear or to which chapter it belongs. To make it easier for you to maintain such equally structured informations, you can define a label info template.

You can add them on review mode either on the whole document, your selected paragraph or on labels. If you add a note to a paragraph, it will only show up on this paragraph. If you have notes that you want on multiple places but not on the complete document, labels are what you're looking for.

A note on label value 37 of label Scenes is your friend. What is a document link? \u00b6 A document link is another type of context information that'll appear on the same place like notes. Just like notes, you can add them to a document, a specific paragraph or a label. Document links give you the possibility to display another document alongside your active document in your note items. This can be especially useful if you have documents for a specific location or character. With document links, you can add them to the place where you need them and don't need to switch between documents. Document links will display the document of question in a readonly way.

Add Notes to a label value \u00b6 You can add notes to label values in two ways: First, while you are in a document and have a activated paragraph that has this label value maintained. Second, you can add notes to all values of a label when having the label details opened. Adding notes to a label value while editing a document \u00b6 Please note that you can only add notes to label values that are maintained on your currently selected paragraph.

It remembers how your files looked like at this moment and saves it. This will enable you to have a look to a previous state of a document whenever you need to. In short: A snapshot freezes your data in space and time and preserves it for you. What is a tag? \u00b6 A tag is a \"special name\" for a snapshot. Since writerey is automatically doing snapshots in a certain time intervall and on certain actions, you'll gather quite a few snapshots, even without using the manual feature frequently. It can be a bit hard to find a specific state between all these snapshots, for example your first draft, or the second revision, or the state you've send to your professor or agent. You can use tags to mark these special milestones to find them more quickly when necessary. Create a snapshot \u00b6 Click on the camera icon at the very right, upper corner of the application Input a custom name or confirm the premade one Hint: Snapshotting always snapshot your complete data , application wide. It is not restricted to a certain project. All changes you've done to any data inside writerey will be snapshotted. Hint2: Additional to manual snapshots, writerey snapshots your data automatically in a certain time interval (30 minutes) and on certain actions (like deletion or renaming). Create a tag \u00b6 Click on the Bookmark icon at the very right, upper corner of the application Input a custom name. Please be aware that you can only use a restricted character set and especially no spaces. Attention! A tag is always created on the last snapshot available. It is not automatically generating a new snapshot. That means if you want to tag your current state you first need to do a snapshot and then tag this snapshot. View snapshots and tags \u00b6 Please note: The history function is not implemented yet, but writerey snapshots your files nevertheless. To access these snapshots, you currently need a thirdparty tool to visualize git - for example Github Desktop Client. Please see \"troubleshooting\" . Delete a snapshot \u00b6 Deleting a snapshot is not possible at the moment and will maybe not in future. Snapshots should make sure that you do not lose any data, no matter how old it is or how often you modified the document in the meanwhile. Deleting snapshots contradicts this.
