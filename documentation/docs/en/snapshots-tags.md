# Snapshots and Tags

All 30 minutes - and each time you hit the "Snapshot" Button at the upper right - writerey records a snapshot of all your files and all your projects. It remembers how your files looked like at this moment and saves it. This will enable you to have a look to a previous state of a document whenever you need to.

_Please note: The history function is not implemented yet, but writerey snapshots your files nevertheless. To access these snapshots, you currently need a thirdparty tool to visualize git - for example Github Desktop Client. Please see "troubleshooting"._
