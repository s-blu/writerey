# Projects

## What is a project?

All your writing ideas begin with a project. Inside a project, you can add all the bits and bobs you need for a project. It is a separated place for one certain idea - one certain project - that allows you to concentrate on this one undertaking.

Almost everything (except snapshots) happen in scope of a project. You have separate documents for each project as well as separate labels. This way, you can always start on a fresh state when pursuing your next idea.

## Create a project

- Navigate outside of any project. To do that, click the More Menu at the top of the sidebar and click "Back to Projects"
- Click the blue button on the upper right corner of the sidebar
- A dialog appears. Input a name for your project and submit with "Create"

## Rename a project

- Navigate outside of any project. To do that, click the More Menu at the top of the sidebar and click "Back to Projects"
- Hover over the project you want to rename
- Click on the "More" Menu on the explorer entry
- Select "Rename"
- A dialog appears. Type in the new name.
- Click "Rename"

_Technical note_: On every rename, writerey creates a snapshot to reflect this change. Don't wonder: If you do a rename only in a casesensitive way (i.e. "characters" to "Characters") writerey will create two snapshots to prevent problems that can occur on these cases.

## Delete a project

- Navigate outside of any project. To do that, click the More Menu at the top of the sidebar and click "Back to Projects"
- In the explorer, hover over the project you want to delete
- Click on the More Menu on the explorer entry
- Select "Delete"
- Confirm the dialog that pops up

_Technical note_: On every delete, writerey creates a snapshot _before_ deleting anything to give you a chance to get it back, if necessary.
