## What is a project?

All your writing ideas begin with a project. Inside a project, you can add all the bits and bobs you need for a project. It is a separated place for one certain idea - one certain project - that allows you to concentrate on this one undertaking.

## Create a project

- Navigate outside of any project. To do that, click the More Menu at the top of the sidebar and click "Back to Projects"
- Click the blue button on the upper right corner of the sidebar
- A dialog appears. Input a name for your project and submit with "Create"
