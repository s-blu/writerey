# Labels

## What is a label?

Labels are here to help you _categorize_ parts of your document.

Does this paragraph belong to chapter 1,2 or 14? Is this paragraph a first draft, the second one or already final? Which scene it belongs to? Which story line? Who's the Point of View character?

The label itself is only like a folder for files. To really use them, you need to add values to them. A value consists of two properties: A name and a info (or description). The name is the real value and what you will choose when assigning labels (see below). The info on the other hand will show up as a special kind of note, so this is the right place to add all the important bits that concern this label value.

## Rename labels

- Switch the tab in the sidebar to "Labels"

- Under tab "details", change the name of the label
- Hit Save

## Delete labels

- Switch the tab in the sidebar to "Labels"
- Hover over the label you want to delete
- Click on the More Menu on the folder entry
- Select "Delete"

_Technical note_: On every delete, writerey creates a snapshot _before_ deleting something to give you a chance to get it back, if necessary.

## Save labels

When on a label detail view, you can save your changes by clicking the blue "Save" Button at the bottom of the page.

Alternatively, you can enable automatic saving. Automatic saving on labels works just like it does on documents: If you change anything, no matter in which tab or field, and do a tiny pause, it will save the label.

### Activate automatic saving

Autosaving is enabled by default. You can disable it application-wide by clicking the "Autosave is on" text right from the Save Button. 

## Create label values

- Navigate into a label
- Switch tabs to "Values"
- Scroll down if necessary
- Click on "Add new label value"

## Rename label values

- Navigate into a label
- Switch tabs to "Values"
- Scroll to the label value you want to rename
- Input the new name in input field "Value"
- Click Save if autosave is off

## Delete label values

- Navigate into a label
- Switch tabs to "Values"
- Scroll to the label value you want to delete
- Click on the - Button right from the name input field
- Confirm the dialog that pops up
- Click Save if autosave is off

Please be aware that this also deletes all the note items that were associated with this label value.
