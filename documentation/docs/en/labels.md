# Labels

## What is a label?

Labels are here to help you _categorize_ parts of your document.

Does this paragraph belong to chapter 1,2 or 14? Is this paragraph a first draft, the second one or already final? Which scene it belongs to? Which story line? Who's the Point of View character?

The label itself is only like a folder for files. To really use them, you need to add values to them. A value consists of two properties: A name and a info (or description). The name is the real value and what you will choose when assigning labels (see below). The info on the other hand will show up as a special kind of note, so this is the right place to add all the important bits that concern this label value.
