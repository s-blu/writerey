## What is a document?

## Create a document

You can create documents only inside of a project.

## Rename a document

## Move a document

## Delete a document

## Use the Editor

Writerey uses CKEditor 5. Most of the handling works just like in any other writing application. If you have doubts or question, the official [CKEditor website](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/) is probably a good place to look.

## Switch document modes

Right below the editor, you have three modes available. When you click on one of t hese, your document switches mode. Let's have a look on them.

### Read

The Read mode gets all the clunky, distracting stuff out of the way and puts your document into a readonly state. This way, you can check (or simply enjoy) your work without distraction.

_Tip_: To achieve the same for the other modes, hit the distraction free mode button (eye) on the lower left corner.

### Write

You will probably stay in Write Mode most of the time. It lets you edit your document and shows you all the context informations you need to craft your next masterpiece (or homework).

### Review

Did you wonder about the context information I mentioned just now? The review mode is where you add them. Here, you can review your document and add two kinds of information: labels and notes. These information will then show up on Write mode to help you improve your document.

## Activate a paragraph

Either click into a paragraph or put the writing cursor into it. After a short moment, a thin blue border will appear on the left side. This paragraph is now active.

You'll now see its label and note informations and be able to edit both for this specific paragraph.

## Save a document

Writerey saves automatically for you, every time you do a tiny writing pause. You see that your document got saved when the Save Icon in the lower right corner wiggles.

## Access documents outside of writerey

Do you wonder where your precious ideas go? Don't worry: Right on your disk space, always accessable for you, even without the app. All documents are saved as .html files under `<installation path of writerey>/_writerey_data/<project-name>/` to make sure you can always access your work, no matter the circumstances.

## Add label values to paragraphs

After you have created a label and its value, you can assign them.

1. Go back to your document
1. Switch to review mode
1. Click on a paragraph

On the left side, you'll now have your created labels displayed. Choose the values you want to assign to this paragraph. When you now switch back to Write mode and your cursor is inside this paragraph, your labels will show up and - if available - you'll see your label info on the right side.

## Add label values to documents

Currently, you can only add label values to specific paragraphs. Improvements are planned in the future, please refer to the Roadmap.
