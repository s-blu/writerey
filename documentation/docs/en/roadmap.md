# Roadmap

writerey is still in active development and has way to go until it hits v1.0. Here, we want to give you a overview what you can expect in future.

This is of course subject to change. It is furthermore not possible to give a time frame since writerey is a hobby project that needs to share the little, available free time with other cool stuff.

You can have a up-to-date, more detailled and more technical look on the roadmap [here](https://github.com/s-blu/writerey/projects/7).

## version 0.9

Version 0.9 focuses on reducing technical debt as well as bug fixing, so there are no big features planned here. Improvements on the documentation will also be part of v0.9 versions.

## version 0.10

0.10 will introduce several improvements on the **note system**. The note system is one of the core features of writerey and we want it to be better useable, more intuitive, and more feature rich.

We also plan to further **improve usability and UI**.

## version 0.11

0.11 will introduce the **Template Feature**. With that, you'll be able to define template documents and projects that you can select when creating a new document or project. This will come handy for repeating things like character sheets.

## version 0.12

0.12 will introduce the **history** to view and access your snapshots in-app. Additionally, we want to work on a **easier setup**, so that you do not need to install Python & Git separately anymore.

## version 1.0

Until version 1.0 we plan to add the following features:

- A automated remote backup of your files on a configurable place
- Interactive user guide explaining the application
- Export documents to different formats like Word
- A settings page that lets you further customize your app, i.e. choose a default font & font size for your documents
