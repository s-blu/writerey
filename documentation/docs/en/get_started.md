# Get started

Welcome to the writerey! Let's have a look what you can do when you have a brand-new installation

- First thing, you should have an rough idea or task. Since you got this far, you probably have that.
- To be able to use writerey, you need a [project](../projects/#what-is-a-project). Learn [here how to create one](../projects/#create-a-project).
- Give it a name that lets you identify which idea or task this project is about
- To be able to use the editor and start writing, you need to [create a document](../documents/#create-a-document)

That's it! You can organize your documents in [folders](../folders/), add context informations with [notes](../note-items/) and [labels](../labels/) and save your revisions with [snapshots and tags](../snapshots-tags/).

Happy writing!
