# Note Items

## What is a note?

A Note is a little piece of additional information, just like a sticky notes You can add them on review mode either on the whole document, or your selected paragraph - or on your labels.

If you add a note to a paragraph, it will only show up on this paragraph. If you have notes that you want on multiple places but not on the complete document, labels are what you're looking for. By putting notes on label values, they'll show up on each paragraph that belongs to this label value.

You're having a ton of background information to that church scene 37 takes place? Label value `37` of label `Scenes` is your friend.
