# Note Items

## What is a note?

A Note is a little piece of additional information, just like a sticky note. You can add them on review mode either on the whole document, your selected paragraph or on labels.

If you add a note to a paragraph, it will only show up on this paragraph. If you have notes that you want on multiple places but not on the complete document, labels are what you're looking for. By putting notes on label values, they'll show up on each paragraph that belongs to this label value.

You're having a ton of background information to that church scene 37 takes place? A note on label value `37` of label `Scenes` is your friend.

## What is a document link?

A document link is another type of context information that'll appear on the same place like notes. Just like notes, you can add them to a document, a specific paragraph or a label.

Document links give you the possibility to display another document alongside your active document in your note items. This can be especially useful if you have documents for a specific location or character. With document links, you can add them to the place where you need them and don't need to switch between documents.

Document links will display the document of question in a readonly way.
