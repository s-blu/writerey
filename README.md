# Writerey

Writerey is a tool that wants to help you with your next writing project: A novel, an essay for school, a research, a poem booklet, ... you name it!

It provides you a distraction free place to sort your thoughts and write down your ideas. It keeps your project safe with autosave functionality and snapshots. It provides you handy functionality to note down thoughts and side-infos.

## WARNING: Development paused indefinitely!

It turned out that the technology writerey was initially build on doesn't serve it's vision in a efficient and performant way. To fix this, a rebuild would be necessary - an undertaking that requires a huge amount of dedication and time. Due to changed private circumstances it is unlikely that we'll come around to in fact reimplement writiereys editor mechanism. Therefore, further development of writerey is paused and it is open if we will ever return to this project.

It was fun while it lasted!

## Attention: Still in Beta

Please be aware that writerey is still in development and did not hit v1.0 yet. Some things are broken, some are incomplete, some are simply not available yet.

With that said, writerey is in a useable state and we try our best to ensure backward compatibility so that you won't lose any data. If you are interested into having a early look, please be welcome to try it out. We would value your constructive feedback a lot!

If you prefer to wait for a comfortable and stable version, please visit us again when we hit v1.0 :)

Thank you!
